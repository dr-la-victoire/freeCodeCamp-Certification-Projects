# freeCodeCamp-Certification-Projects
This is the README for freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design course.
In this course, you have to build 5 projects to earn the certificate. 
The course basically teaches HTML and CSS, and how to build web pages that respond to various screen sizes. 
CERTIFICATE PROJECT #1 - BUILDING A SURVEY FORM In this project, I built a simple form with HTML and CSS. 
The purpose of this form was to teach the basics of HTML and CSS, especially as it concerns responsiveness. 
Basic concepts like elements, attributes, and the likes.
