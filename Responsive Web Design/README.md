This is the README for freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design course. In this course, you have to build 5 projects to earn the certificate.
The course basically teaches HTML and CSS, and how to build web pages that respond to various screen sizes.
CERTIFICATE PROJECT #1 - BUILDING A SURVEY FORM
In this project, I built a simple form with HTML and CSS. The purpose of this form waas to teach the basics of HTML and CSS, especially as it concerns responsiveness. Basic concepts like elements, attributes, and the likes.
CERTIFICATE PROJECT #2 - BUILDING A TRIBUTE PAGE
In this project, I built a simple web page showing the timeline of a famous person's life. This project taught me to handle
simple layout of a web page, especially working with divs and lists.
CERTIFICATE PROJECT #3 - BUILDING A TECHNICAL DOCUMENTATION PAGE
In this project, I built a simple documentation web page for Javascript. This project taught me to use more CSS features like flexbox. I also used media queries as I designed to fit different screen sizes. I learned more about layout and navbar design as I made the navbar float to the left on bigger screens, and collapse on top of the main content on smaller screens.
